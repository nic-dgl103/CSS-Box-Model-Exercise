2. In VS Code, add embedded styles to the index.html file to make it look like the example below: 
![image](images/example.png)<br/>

  * Read through the HTML to understand how the content was structured.
  * Align all the text in the body HTML element to the center;
  * Give the main HTML element a white background colour and rounded corners (10px radius).
  * Give the main HTML element a shadow using the declaration below <br/>
`{ box-shadow: rgba(149, 157, 165, 0.2) 0px 8px 24px; }`
  * The week 1 and week 2 reading lists are inside section HTML elements. Style the sections with:
      * A border that is 2px thick, solid in style and uses the following hexadecimal colour: #F3F3F3
      * Rounded corners with a 5px radius
      * A background colour of #F7F7F7
      * 20px of padding on all four sides
      * Align their text to the left
      * Restrict their width to 350px
      * Give their text a bit more vertical space by increasing its line height to 1.8rem
      * Set the horizontal margins to auto to horizontally center the element within its parent element, and set the vertical margins to 40px  

   * Style the main HTML element:
      * Read about margin collapse: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/. Give the main HTML element the same border as the section elements to make it respect its chidrens' vertical margins
      * Restrict its width to 500px;
      * Give it the same margins as the section elements

   * Style the header HTML element:
      * Give it a background colour of #257165
      * Change the colour of its text to white
      * Give it 20px of padding on all four sides
      * Round the top left and top right corners with a 10px radius
